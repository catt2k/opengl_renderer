model("../blah.obj");

//loadModel("../blah.obj");

directory = path // (../)

processnode(mRootNode, scene)

for loop number of meshes for the rootnode

push esch mesh to a vector contain meshes with a functin "processmesh"

second for loop number of children node

process them like the root node


target of setup a model -> setup a vector of mesh*******

each mesh has some data to pass into shader in order to draw them
e.g. 
     //Vertex     //Indices      //Textures
     1. position  1.unsigned int 1. id
     2. normal                   2. type
     3. texcroods                3. path
     4. tangent 
     5. bitangent
and all of these propertites are vector too!

processmesh: find init for each mesh i.e. vector of vertex, indices and texture

for loop number of vertices

push vertex to "vertex vector" -> finish mesh.vertex

for loop number of faces

push indices                   -> finish mesh.indices

push material                  -> finish mesh.textures

Last Step!
Draw the Model:

loop every mesh in the vector<mesh> stored early on
and call their draw function to draw
